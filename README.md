Waves
=====

Waves is the easiest way to 'own' the websites that you use.

Imagine being able to bend every website to your preferences? Waves creates an .app of any website and gives a friendly and easy to use interface to modify and remove any element from the page.

It also supports manual CSS and JavaScript injection.

**In other words Waves is everything we wanted [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) to be.**
